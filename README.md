Deribit API Trading System in C++
This project is a trading system built in C++ for interacting with the Deribit Test API. It allows you to place, cancel, modify orders, view the order book, and retrieve current position details on the Deribit platform(https://test.deribit.com/). The project uses cURL for HTTP requests and nlohmann/json for JSON parsing.

Features
Order Placement: Submit orders at specific price and quantity for various instruments.
Order Management: Cancel and modify existing orders.
Order Book Retrieval: View detailed order book data including bids, asks, and market information.
Position Details: Retrieve position details for a specific instrument.
Requirements
C++ Compiler: GCC (recommended) or any modern C++ compiler with C++11 support.
cURL: Library for HTTP requests.
JSON for Modern C++: Header-only library for JSON parsing by nlohmann/json.
Dependencies
cURL: Install via the following commands:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev
JSON for Modern C++: Download the header file from nlohmann/json GitHub page or install via a package manager:

sudo apt install nlohmann-json3-dev
Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Ensure the necessary libraries (curl and nlohmann/json) are installed.

Add the path to json.hpp if it's not already in your include path:

Place json.hpp in the include/ directory within the project.
